# Heat Map

Another freeCodeCamp data visualization project using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to plot information from a JSON source. I kind of like these projects. Data visualization is part of the practice of digital humanities - this is, after all, why I am learning to code. I see a Sun Ra scatterplot graph in my future...

In any case, I should probably add a [link to the project specs](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map).
